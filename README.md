# First test project using VS Code for GIT and Python

# CHSH inequality simulator

This project simulates the CHSH game for two-qubit states and evaluates
the Bell inequality violation under different noise models.

## Features
- Ideal singlet state
- Depolarizing noise
- CHSH value calculation
- Visualization of violation vs noise

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Example
Run the notebook in `notebooks/demo.ipynb`.
