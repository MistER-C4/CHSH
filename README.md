# First test project using VS Code for GIT and Python

# CHSH Game simulator

In this project I am revisiting my Master's Thesis and coding the CHSH game using the data I obtained in the laboratory.
The goal is to simulate the CHSH Game in the classical case and then use entangled photons to play the quantum version to show quantum advantage. 

## Features
- Ideal singlet state
- Depolarizing noise
- CHSH value calculation
- Visualization of violation vs noise

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Example
Run the notebook in `notebooks/demo.ipynb`.

## Goal

- Calculate and visualize the game
- Create an interface for 2 players to play the game
